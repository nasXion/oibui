								<p>Your magnificence astounds me. I can't decide what it is about you that I adore the most. Your eyes, nose, lips, and appearance all contribute to your attractiveness.
									 In my opinion, there's no one component of you that stands out above the others. 
									 I'm in awe of every aspect of your being. It's a pleasure to meet you. <span class="icon fa-heart"> Eu littol happiness</span>.</p>
								<p>You have a beautiful pair of eyes. I become drowned in an ocean of endless optimism, fulfillment, and harmony whenever I stare into them.
									 This hope gives me peace, happiness surrounds me at all times, and harmony reminds me that I'm somewhere above the earth <span class="icon fa-heart"></span></p>

								<h2 class="major">From Your Oi</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Getting lost in your eyes is one of the most wonderful experiences in the world. I was born to stare at you, and I would do everything to go back in time and meet you sooner.<span class="icon fa-heart"></span> You have the most gorgeous eyes that penetrate through my soul and mind to bring out the best in me, and I would never give you up for anything in the world. I adore you more than I adore life itself. I had no clue such things as sweetness and laziness existed until meeting you. I'm like a unique language that only you comprehend. No one understands me like you do, and no one makes me happier than you do. You already know what I need without having to think about it. Because of your concern, love, and compassion, I am your open book. Thank you very much!
								</p>
								<p>I haven't spoken it in a long time, but I adore everything about you.<span class="icon fa-heart"></span> I like your hair, your sense of style, the way you make me smile, but most of all, I adore the way you make me feel alive. I can't thank you enough for making me feel like the luckiest and most wonderful person on the planet. Every day, I try to be the guy you need because you deserve all the happiness in the world.</p>

								<h2 class="major">appreciation</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I just wanted to say how much I appreciate having you in my life. It means a lot to me that you helped me get through bad times and that you were there to help me enjoy good times. 
									Thank you for being a part of my life. I think I'm very lucky to have you by my side. Every time you do something nice for me, I don't forget. 
									I don't know what I did to get someone as good as you, but I will always be grateful for your love, support, and kindness. I will never forget how you made me feel. </p>
									<p>Thank you for being who you are and for letting me be a part of your life.<span class="icon fa-heart"></span> I love you! When you're not around, my world looks dark. There is a haze even when there are no clouds in the sky.
									 In the world before you, there were street lights, stars and the moon and sun. Now, you seem to be the most important thing in my life.
									 It would explain why I feel so warm when I'm with you, and why you give me the energy and courage to keep going in my darkest hours.<span class="icon fa-heart"></span> So I know I'll always find my way back to you.</p>
